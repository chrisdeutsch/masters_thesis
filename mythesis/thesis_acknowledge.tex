This thesis would not have been possible without the help, guidance and support
of many people. Therefore, I would like to thank:
\begin{itemize}
\item Prof.\ Dr.\ Jochen Dingfelder for giving me the opportunity to write my
  thesis in his working group and for his continued support.

\item Prof.\ Dr.\ Klaus Desch for his willingness to be the co-examiner.

\item Dr.\ William Davey for his excellent supervision, guidance and the many
  fruitful discussions.

\item Benedict Winter for his valuable advice and him sharing his vast
  knowledge of physics with me.

\item My (past) office colleagues Verena Muckhoff, Jan Heinrichs, and Christos
  Vergis for the enjoyable office atmosphere.

\item All of my colleagues in the working group of Prof.\ Dingfelder.

\item My family for providing me with support and stability during my studies.

\end{itemize}
