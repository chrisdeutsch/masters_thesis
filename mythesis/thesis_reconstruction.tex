\chapter{Reconstruction, Energy Calibration and
  Identification of Hadronic Tau Lepton Decays}
\label{sec:reconstruction}

This chapter summarises the offline reconstruction procedure used at ATLAS to
reconstruct hadronic decays of tau leptons as given in \cite{atlas:taurec:run1,
  atlas:taurec:run2}. Additionally more recent changes to the reconstruction
algorithms are included.

Candidates for hadronic tau decays are seeded by jets formed by the
anti-$k_\mathrm{t}$ jet algorithm using a distance parameter of $R = 0.4$ on
three-dimensional clusters of calorimeter cells called \emph{TopoClusters}
calibrated using the local hadronic calibration (LC-scale). The jet seed has to
satisfy $p_\mathrm{T} > \SI{10}{GeV}$ and $|\eta| < \num{2.5}$. \todo{At this
  step tau $p_\mathrm{T}, \eta, \varphi, m$ ($m$: invariant mass) are set to the
  ones of the jet seed -- what does this mean? Read up on jet algs}

In events with multiple primary vertices the tau production vertex has to be
identified. Reconstructed tracks associated to the calorimeter jet via
ghost-matching\footnote{Tracks matched unambiguously to calorimeter jets by
  adding the tracks with infinitesimal energy to the constituent list and
  rerunning the jet algorithm.} that lie in a cone of $\Delta R < 0.2$ with
respect to the jet axis and fulfil $p_\mathrm{T} > \SI{1}{\giga\electronvolt}$
and basic track quality criteria $N_\mathrm{Pixel} \geq 2$ (PixelHits +
PixelDeadSensors) and $N_\mathrm{Si} \geq 7$ (PixelHits + SCTHits +
PixelDeadSensors + SCTDeadSensors) are selected. The primary vertex is then
associated to be the one maximising the Jet Vertex Fraction
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{JVF} = \frac{\sum_\text{Vtx.\ \& TJVA} p_\mathrm{T}}
                                           {\sum_\text{TJVA} p_\mathrm{T}}
\end{align*}
given by the ratio of the $p_\mathrm{T}$ sum of all selected tracks that are
also matched to the vertex\footnote{Impact parameter based association with the
  primary vertex. $|d_0| < \SI{2.5}{mm}$ with respect to beamline and
  $|(\Delta z_0) \sin\theta| < \SI{3}{mm}$. $\Delta z_0$ is the longitudinal
  distance of vertex and track} to the sum of $p_\mathrm{T}$ of all selected
tracks.

The LC calibrated energy of the tau is set to the energy of all
\emph{TopoClusters} within a cone of $\DeltaR < 0.2$ with respect to the
barycentre\footnote{$\eta$ and $\phi$ of the four momentum vector given by the
  sum of all cluster 4-momenta.} of all clusters of the jet at LC scale
(\texttt{ptDetectorAxis}). \todo{This part could be in the first paragraph}.
Finally the tau axis ($\eta$, $\phi$\footnote{strictly also $p_\mathrm{T}$ as a
  result}) is corrected for the position of the primary vertex
(\texttt{ptIntermediateAxis}). After the axis correction and the identification
of the primary vertex, the track impact parameters can be recalculated with
respect to the primary vertex (like for z0sinThetaTJVA).

% Vertex association: Tracks matched unambiguously to jets via ghost-matching by
% adding all tracks into constituent list for the jet algorithm but setting
% their energy infinitesimally small (such that the result of the jet algorithm
% is not affected due to IR-safety) and rerunning the algorithm.

\item Building jet seed from AntiKt4LCTopoJets ($p_\mathrm{T} > \SI{10}{GeV}$)

\item Vertex finding \& TJVA (Track Selection $\Delta R < 0.2$ \& PixHits /
  SiHits requirement, Jet Vertex Fraction)

\item Energy \& axis calculation (clusters within $\Delta R < 0.2$ w.r.t.
  barycentre associated with tau [ptDetectorAxis], correct axis for vertex
  position [ptIntermediateAxis])

\item Track selection \& track classification (MVA tracking TT/CT/IT/FT, sets
  charge/prongness, modifiedIsolationTracks, Multijet rejection from
  \texttt{nTrack} requirement)

\item Energy Calibration: LC \textrightarrow TES (Separately for 1-prong and
  multi-prong: subtract PU energy using $N_\mathrm{PV}$ / $\mu$, apply
  calibration factor depending on $|\eta|$ \& $E_\mathrm{LC} - E_\mathrm{PU}$

\item Tau-ID (Could be moved to next chapter?)

\item Substructure Reconstruction (?)
