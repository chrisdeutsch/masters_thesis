Focus more on whats the content of this thesis. (Should give a good overview of
whats going on if only Introduction \& Conclusion is read by the reader)

\begin{itemize}
\item LHC \& Experiments
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Discoveries / Measurements

  \item Past: Run-I, Present: Run-II, Future: HL-LHC \& Challenges
  \end{itemize}

\item $\tau$-Leptons
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Importance (Fermionic coupling of Higgs, Higgs CP, Exotics $Z^\prime$,
    $W^\prime$, Heavy Higgs / SUSY)
  \item $\tau$-decay (hadronic branching fraction, decay modes)
  \item Jets faking taus (necessity of identification algorithms)
  \item Classification of $\tau$ decay modes (motivation)
  \end{itemize}

\item Overview of the thesis structure (one bullet point per chapter).
\end{itemize}

\section{TODO}
\label{sec:TODO}

\begin{itemize}
\item Select BDT from Grid Search for further studies (Have a robust \& 'safe'
  BDT and the best performing one)
\item Prepare number of Track \& number of Clusters scan (Do it for 1-prong and
  3-prong)
\item LSTM Cell Size Scan $n_c \in \{8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64\}$ (3P track RNN
  maybe not optimised?)
\item From the RNNs: Group variables into groups, e.g. Impact parameters,
  kinematic quantities, inner detector hits, energy fractions, moments etc. and
  drop whole groups to gauge importance of the variables
\item Now that the Track \& Cluster-RNN switched to preprocessing on a per
  variable basis investigate switching to this as well for the PFO-RNN. Also
  apply constant\_scale(0.4) on dEta/dPhi instead of regular scale.
\item In Rejection plots zorder still fucked
\item Tau-ID BDT -- Use nTracks/nClusters cmp.\ plots for ntrack/ncluster scan
  in RNN part
\item Study pile-up dependency of RNN vs.\ regular ID
\item Try putting the sign of the impact parameter into Track-RNN
\item Use $d_0$-significance instead of raw value
  \url{https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasProtected/InDetTrackingDC14#Impact_parameters_z0_d0_definiti}
\item Define Rejection -- Inverse Background Efficiency
\item Check plots for British English e.g. normalised instead of normalized
  (cmp. appendix)
\end{itemize}
