Final states containing hadronic tau-lepton decays play important role in ATLAS
physics programme (due to high branching fraction of hadronic modes). Examples:
SM measurements, Higgs boson searches, BSM (extended higgs sector, SUSY),
exotics (heavy gauge bosons), leptoquarks. Also Fermionic Coupling of Higgs,
Higgs CP. These analyses heavily depend on robust reconstruction of the hadronic
decay and particle identification suppressing backgrounds from QCD jets,
electrons and muons faking hadronic tau decays.

Paragraph about jets faking taus (why are identification algorithms necessary).

This thesis summarises the improvements of the algorithm currently used for
tau-identification at the ATLAS experiment. Moreover a novel approach to
identifying hadronic tau-lepton decays based on Recurrent Neural Networks is
presented. Finally the methods are applied to

This thesis is structured as follows: Theoretical Background, ATLAS Experiment
at the LHC, Reconstruction, Energy Calibration and Identification, Machine
Learning, Identification of Hadronic Tau-Lepton Decays using BDTs,
Identification using (Recurrent) Neural Networks, Application in Decay Mode
Classification.

Focus more on whats the content of this thesis. (Should give a good overview of
whats going on if only Introduction \& Conclusion is read by the reader)
