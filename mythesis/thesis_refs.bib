  abstract =     "Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of
                  multiple processing layers to learn representations of data
                  with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have
                  dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech
                  recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and
                  many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep
                  learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by
                  using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine
                  should change its internal parameters that are used to compute
                  the representation in each layer from the representation in
                  the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about
                  breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio,
                  whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data
                  such as text and speech.",
