\begin{itemize}
\item Tau lepton

\item Weak \& strong interaction (?)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Cross section plot multijet (large cross section) vs.
    electroweak interaction (small)
  \item \url{http://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/~wstirlin/plots/plots.html}
  \item Quark vs Gluon jets: \url{http://jets.physics.harvard.edu/qvg/}
    Because of different colour interaction and hadronization, gluon jets are
    wider, with higher multiplicity and have a more uniform energy
    fragmentation, while quark jets are more likely to produce narrow jets with
    hard constituents that carry a significant fraction of the energy.
  \end{itemize}

\item Tau decay modes \& branching fractions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Hadronic decays not containing pions but kaons etc.
  \end{itemize}

\item Intermediate resonances $a$, $\rho$

\item Jets (anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$)

\end{itemize}
